React stores states corresponding to hooks defined in component.
React uses sequence of call to these hooks to determine which store state associates with which book call.
If used with conditionals or loops, the sequence of hook calls may associate wrong stored state with strong call across re-renders.
This can cause bugs or unexpected behaviour.
